                We would love to highlight all the Latinx student clubs on campus
                who are making Cal Poly a better place! If you are a student interested in 
                any of these, be sure to follow them on Instagram!

                <h2>Latinx Business Student Association</h2>
                <p>
                    LBSA was started at Cal Poly in 1984 by first-generation Cal Poly
                    student Maria Rodriguez-Arvizu. The club's purpose is two-fold:
                    to promote and encourage the development of future leaders, and to
                    increase the representation of Latinx professionals in business.
                    LBSA is not restricted to students within the Orfalea College
                    of Business; students from all six of Cal Poly's colleges are
                    welcome and encouraged to attend meetings.

                <h2>Latinx Cultural Assocation</h2>
                <p>
                    During PolyCultural Weekend in 2019, five Cal Poly students were 
                    inspired to start a club empowering Latinx students on campus,
                    and they founded LCA to provide an inclusive space for students to 
                    celebrate their heritage and foster a sense of belonging. LCA has
                    quickly become a hub for cultural exchange, and the club continues 
                    to evolve and thrive.

                <h2>Latinos in Agriculture</h2>
                <p>
                    Latinos in Agriculture aims to promote diversity and higher education
                    among agricultural majors. They hold events to help students
                    feel comfortable and they connect students with resources to help
                    them succeed. As a local chapter of MANRRS, a national society
                    promoting academic and professional advancement by empowering
                    minorities in agriculture, LIA offers opportunities for competition,
                    networking, and travel through regional and national conferences.

                <h2>Movimiento Estudiantil Xicanx de Aztlan</h2>
                <p>
                    Movimiento Estudiantil Xicanx de Aztlan was formed in 1969 by
                    students at University of California Santa Barbara as a way to
                    unite Chicanos on-campus in the midst of the civil rights
                    movements and the adoption of the term "Chicano" by second- and 
                    third-generation students. At Cal Poly, MEXA's goals are to 
                    help students achieve their goals in higher education and preserve and study
                    their history and culture.

                    Cal Poly's chapter of Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers 
                    was started in 1978 as part of a university commitment to recruiting
                    and retaining Hispanic and Latinx students in STEM. SHPE assist their
                    community by providing recruitment and tutoring programs, and 
                    they work to ensure that the Hispanic/Latine students at Cal Poly
                    are able to find their home away from home.
