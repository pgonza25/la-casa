                Hello! This is the website for Cal Poly's Latinx/e Center for
                Academic Success and Achievement, lovingly known as La CASA!
                We strive to foster community among Latinx students on campus
                by offering a space for studying, relaxing, and hanging out, as
                well as programming and events held year-round to make La CASA
                truly feel like home. We are located in Building 52 Room E22, so
                be sure to visit us!

        <h2>La CASA's Background</h2>
        <div class="left">
            <p id="history">
                For years prior to the opening of La CASA's physical space in Building 52, 
                students on campus had been expressing the need for an area where
                Latinx students and allies could be in community with each other to
                create a greater sense of unity among the student body, to expose students
                to the host of resources available to them at Cal Poly, and to encourage
                students to continue paving their way to success and showing future classes
                of students that people who identify as Latinx are a force on Cal Poly&apos;s
                campus.
                <br>
                In February 2022, newly-hired coordinator Daisy Paniagua-Uribe and 
                Student Diversity and Belonging started what was then known as Latinx
                Initiatives. Daisy and her inaugural team of 4 student assistants, 
                Esperanza, Britney, Griselda, and Pablo, began planning and brainstorming
                ideas for the space that would eventually become La CASA, the home away
                from home that they knew many students desired.

        <p id="underimage">
            Their planning culminated in the grand opening of La CASA in November
            2022, making La CASA a little more than 1 year old! La CASA is very grateful 
            for all the students that breathe life into it and make it an inviting
            and exciting place to be. We couldn't do it without them.
