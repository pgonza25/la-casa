                Every June, Cal Poly holds a special commencement ceremony for Chicanx
                and Latinx students. Here are some Frequently Asked Questions to
                help inform you about the event!

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Chicanx/Latinx commencement is a graduation ceremony for Chicanx and
                Latinx-identifying students. There is one ceremony for everyone 
                regardless of the college their major resides in, and it is a much
                smaller and more intimate ceremony than those for individual colleges,
                so you all get more recognition!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>When is Chicanx/Latinx Commencement held?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Chicanx/Latinx Commencement takes place at the end of spring quarter,
                but there is no singular date that it falls on year after year. Best
                efforts are made to ensure that CLC does not conflict with any of the 
                college commencements, although there is no guarantee as CLC typically
                is held in the Performing Arts Center and the space is used to host other
                events and performances. For updates on the date and time for your 
                class' CLC, please keep in touch with La CASA on Instagram.

        <div>
            <p>
                If you would like to participate in Chicanx/Latinx Commencement,
                there is an interest form that is sent out a couple months in advance
                where you can add your name to the list of graduates who will be
                participating. It is completely free for you to participate in and
                for your friends and family to attend, so we encourage everyone to
                be a part of it!
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Will I receive a special stole for participating in CLC?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Yes, you will receive a stole as a participant in Chicanx/Latinx
                Commencement, as well as a special certificate and other small goodies!
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>I won't be participating in CLC, but may I still receive a stole?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                Of course! When you fill out the interest form, there should be an
                option to mark that you will not be attending the ceremony, but that 
                you would still like to receive the stole and other gifts.
