                <p>Celebrate Latinx Heritage Month with us every year from
                    September 15th to October 15th! Big events during the month
                    include our Día de los Muertos event featuring ofrendas and
                    sugar skull painting, as well as a fun "Welcome Back" party

                <h2>State of Latinx</h2>
                <p>State of Latinx is an annual event held during Latinx Heritage Month
                    that spotlights the culture, stories, and experiences of the
                    Latinx community. Join us as we bring together campus leaders
                    to engage in critical dialogue around what it means to be
                    Latinx at Cal Poly.

                <p>Día de los Muertos falls during Latinx Heritage Month as well,
                    and we have an all-day celebration to allow students and community
                    members to honor their loved ones. We reserve the University Union
                    stage for students to build ofrendas, and we also make and paint
                    sugar skulls and enjoy some Pan de Muerto.

                <h2>Cafecito con Pan Dulce</h2>
                <p>SLO doesn't have any panaderías, and we missed the experience
                    of sitting together with our favorite pan dulce and a hot 
                    coffee. We thought you might feel the same, so once a month
                    we team up with our friends at the Native American and 
                    Indigenous Cultural Center to bring it to you on-campus!
